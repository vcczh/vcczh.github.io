      <description>This is the very beginning of my blog.
So, why I blog?  To blog is to learn. It helps me re-enforce the mind power for retrieving the knowledge and re-index the whole staff that I learned. A lot of learning theories are behind this. (May summarize them in other posts later&amp;hellip;) The whole point is that I blog for myself first, ha~ so selfish. This is DAY ONE and not sure how long and how frequent I blog.</description>
