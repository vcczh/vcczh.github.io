<p>This is the very beginning of my blog.</p>

<h2 id="so-why-i-blog">So, why I blog?</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><em>To blog is to learn.</em> <br /> It helps me re-enforce the mind power for retrieving the knowledge and re-index the whole staff that I learned. A lot of learning theories are behind this. (May summarize them in other posts later&hellip;) The whole point is that I blog for myself first, ha~ so selfish. This is <em>DAY ONE</em> and not sure how long and how frequent I blog. But I promise that I will let you know whether it helps or not at the <em>END</em>.</p></li>

<li><p><em>To blog is to share.</em> <br /> Of course, every post here is written to be read and shared.</p>

<ul>
<li>First of all, apologize for my bad writing skills. English is not my native language and to improve the writing skill is one of the motivations as mentioned above. (To me, doing to learn is more than learning to do.)</li>
<li>Secondly, I hope the blog can help you, save your time and at least have some fun witnessing my naiveness.</li>
<li>Thirdly, to share is to get your feedback. Your feedback will help me escape from my cognitive bias and let me know you. (The comment feature is still under construction&hellip; Contact me via LinkedIn or the way you can. Ha~)</li>
<li>Finally, I believe in <em>open source</em> and <em>knowledge sharing</em>. By sharing, it lowers the cost of knowledge itself which benefits more people. (Try my best to make my post correct and accurate. False information may have negative and unintended impact that I never want. Let me if it happens.) So feel free to share. Besides that, I would like to add one and only one rule of sharing any content from my blog: it is to reference the source.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Zhiheng (Victor) Chu</p>
